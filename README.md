# FitLit

Mod 2 - Paired Project

## Goals (from the project spec)

* Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way on multiple screens
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data

## Abstract

The Fitlit paired project is designed for Module 2 students in the Front End Program at the Turing School of Software Design. The project focuses on building an application implementing the ES6 syntax and using Test-driven-development(TDD) for each class and method as well. We were tasked with writing dry code using array-prototype methods and working with Fetched data for the first time. The final piece was tying all of the files together and having a page design that easily shows a given user's data on the page.

## Technologies

* NPM package/Webpack
* JavaScript
* Mocha
* Chai
* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery

## Setup

1. Fork this repo (look up in the top right corner) and copy the SSH link.
2. Open your terminal, run git clone (replace the [ ] with the copied remote address.
3. Change into the directory and type the following to view page:
   run npm install and then src/open index.html

## Code Architecture  

* The src directory contains the classes and the testing files are in the test directory.
* The Fetch calls are contained in the webApi.js
* The scripts.js file works with all the files to render the page functionality.

## Wins

* Keeping organized as a team on the project and where we are at in each step along the way using Github Projects
* Writing functional ES6 classes that all communicate and complete the MVP for the project
* Learning some new tools such as MIRO for project planning and wire framing
* Sticking to DTR and supporting one another in making sure to get other work done outside of the project
* Getting the Fetch data to work after hours of research and working with mentors, rocks, and classmates.
* Writing the class methods and test-driven-development easier than any other project so far.

## Challenges

* Getting the Fetch calls connected and trying to make them dynamic.
* Understanding the scripts.js vs update.Dom.js separation
* Taking on such a large project while school and life continued on.  

## Future Designs/Extensions

* Add images and more color to the webpage to be more attractive to users
* Add the Activity Iteration of the spec
* Use chart.js library to display the data
* Design a step challenge between user's friends
