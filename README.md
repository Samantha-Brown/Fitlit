# FitLit

Mod 2 - Paired Project

## Goals (from the project spec)

* Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way on multiple screens
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data

## Abstract

The Fitlit paired project is designed for Module 2 students in the Front End Program at the Turing School of Software Design. The project focuses on building an application implementing the ES6 syntax and using Test-driven-development(TDD) for each class and method as well. We were tasked with writing dry code using array-prototype methods and working with Fetched data for the first time. The final piece was tying all of the files together and having a page design that easily shows a given user's data on the page.
